## üöÄ Quickstart
Follow instructions for [downloading and installing Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) on you host machine. *If your host machine is Linux then you will also need to [install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).*

```bash
# Download the repo
git clone https://github.com/jackno/jackbox.git
cd jackbox
```

```bash
# Setup
docker-compose run jackbox setup

# Start
docker-compose up jackbox
```

```bash
# Connect to JackBox via SSH
ssh <user>@localhost
```

## üßº Cleanup
‚ö†Ô∏è **Data in the `/etc`, `/opt`, `/home`, and `/var` paths are persistent, but nothing else is.**

```bash
# Close out your session without deleting your data.
docker-compose down jackbox
```

```bash
# The -v option will completely delete all your persistent data. Make sure you back up sensitive files.
docker-compose down jackbox -v
```
